## NESG_Survey_Analysis

This dataset was created by Nigeria Economic Summit Group(NESG) for tax compliance and fuel subsidy, to undercover the perception of Nigerians, the vast majority of whom live outside the FCT and Lagos, whose experience of taxation is primarily with state and local government. Six states were considered, one in each geo-political zone.

* I cleaned the using the power query editor in Powerbi 

* DAX was written to create measures.

### INSIGHTS

* **Low Tax Compliance Rate:** The percentage of individuals that comply with tax regulations and payment of tax is small. As it was shown that 31% income tax, 8% tenement rate, 8% land use
and property tax, 21% market taxes and levies, and 25% business premises and registration fees

* **Decline in Standard of Living and Employment Condition:** Analyzing the current standard of living of the population, it can be seen while comparing the country's current economic
conditions to 1 year ago, the current state is worse compared to 1 year ago, with the majority being skilled manual workers and getting paid full time.

* **Tax Morale to Compliance:** If there is a strong sense of tax morale, it will lead to an increased willingness to adhere to tax payments. This is illustrated by the fact that nearly 20% of the
population believes that not paying taxes is completely acceptable, whereas 12% consider it to be morally wrong and deserving of punishment, Although 60% of the citizens agreed that they
must pay taxes to the government for the country to develop.

* **Challenges in tax payment and government services:** Approximately, 66% of the citizens find it difficult and extremely difficult to find out what taxes and fees should be paid to the
government. WHILE only 14% of the population easily finds out how the government uses tax revenue, which means the government is not transparent enough. The primary factor motivating certain 
individuals to evade government taxes is the poor quality of services provided by the government. Many taxpayers express significant dissatisfaction with a wide array of services, including but not limited to water supply, health clinics, garbage collection, bus services, road
maintenance, security, and electricity.

* **Low Confidence in tax management and Governance:** Roughly 81% of the population believes that the federal government prioritizes its own interests over the well-being of the masses. Therefore, citizen lack trust in the government.
Approximately one-third of the population have confidence in chiefs/traditional leaders to manage tax revenue responsibly, in contrast to the federal, state and local government levels Primary factors against decreasing fuel subsidy:

* The potential negative effect of higher fuel prices, equivalent to reducing fuel subsidies, will have a significant impact, with around 60% of the population feeling the repercussions, while 4%
will remain unaffected. Factors against it include but are not limited to exorbitant hikes in the price of goods, social unrest, etc.

### RECOMMENDATIONS

* **Tax transparency:** Implement tax policies that are easy for citizens to understand, comply with, and assess. Increased compliance rates can be achieved by simplifying tax codes and clearly
communicating tax obligations.

* **Investment in Public Services:** Direct tax revenue to improve healthcare, education, transportation,road maintenance, security and sanitation. These services can directly enhance
citizens' quality of life if they are improved.

* **Efficient Subsidies**: Direct subsidies to sectors that directly benefit citizens and encourage economic growth. In a country, subsidies for essential goods and services like healthcare and
education, grant and aid to village can have a positive effect on citizens' well-being.

* Review and assess tax and subsidy policies periodically to ensure they are effective in benefitting citizens and the economy. Policy adjustments should be based on the observed outcomes.
